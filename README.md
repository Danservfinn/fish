# Fish - Multi-Model Weather Forecast Comparison

🌐 **Live:** https://fish-weather-production.up.railway.app

A weather visualization app that compares forecasts from multiple meteorological models to help you make informed decisions about upcoming weather.

## Features

### Multi-Model Forecast Comparison
Compare forecasts from 6 different weather models:
- **ECMWF** (European) - Gold standard, 9km resolution, 15-day forecast
- **GFS** (American) - NOAA's global model, 25km resolution, 16-day forecast
- **GraphCast** (Google DeepMind AI) - AI-powered predictions, 10-day forecast
- **NBM** (National Blend of Models) - US-focused ensemble, ~3km resolution
- **HRRR** (High-Resolution Rapid Refresh) - 3km, 48-hour US detail
- **ICON** (German) - 13km resolution, 7-day forecast

### Visualization Modes

**Accumulation Mode** - View 7-day precipitation totals:
- Snow accumulation heatmap
- Rain accumulation heatmap
- Total precipitation visualization
- Model-by-model comparison charts

**Live Radar Mode** - Real-time precipitation visualization:
- Current precipitation intensity overlay
- Precipitation type indicators (rain, snow, freezing rain, thunderstorm)
- Animation with historical frames
- Click-for-details popup

### Interactive Map
- Click anywhere to get forecasts for that location
- Geolocation support for current position
- Location search with autocomplete
- Responsive design (desktop + mobile)

## API Data Sources

All weather data is fetched from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/), a free and open weather API:
- Geocoding API for location search
- Forecast API for multi-model predictions
- Minutely/hourly data for live radar animation

## Deployment

Deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app):
- **Production URL**: https://fish-weather-production.up.railway.app
- Auto-deploys on push to `main` branch
- Uses Next.js standalone output for optimized container size
